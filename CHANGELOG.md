# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Initial release of Label Printer Server.

- Persistent label queues, tape profiles and cartridge consumption tracking.
- USB printer management and distribution groups, with print review and durable
  holds after cancellation, interruptions and access changes.
- Visual label editor, reusable templates, image and font libraries, CSV runs,
  and print requests with approvals.
- User accounts, roles and groups, with administrator access previews.
- Administrator deletion of accounts, templates, images and fonts, including
  referenced content. Deleted content is unavailable immediately and can be
  restored for 30 days before purging. Dependent templates show missing-asset
  placeholders and affected print work remains held for review.
- Durable notifications with administrator-managed ntfy endpoints.
- Native systemd and Docker Compose deployment, plus a release updater that
  backs up data, upgrades dependencies, migrates and verifies service health.
- Version display, cached release notifications and private GitHub token support.

PT-P710BT printing has been verified with one physical printer. Multiple physical
printers and HomeBox integration remain deferred. Cancellation may finish the
current label before stopping subsequent labels.
